### Grashey View
- **Anteroposterior**
- 30-40 degree oblique to the coronal plane
- allows estimation of joint space of [[glenohumeral joint]]

### Transcapular “Y” View 
- X-ray in line with the body of the Scapula
- Orthogonal to the AP shoulder
- Allows a better view of the [[Scapula#Acromion Process]] and the [[Scapula#Coracoid Process]]
- Allows us to see [[glenohumeral joint]] dislocation and [[Scapula]] fractures

### Outlet View
- used for [[acromion process]] morphology, coracoacromial arch, space through which the [[Supraspinatus]] crosses
- not a true anterior posterior, but angled posteriorly to view the [[coracoid process]]

### Axillary View
- view into the armpit
- used to evaluate joint space of the [[glenohumeral joint]] and glenohumeral alignment
