## Definition:
High amount of Potassium (K+) on the outside of the cell. 

## Affected Region  
K+ does not want to move out, because the concentration of K+ is higher on the outside. 
Cell will depolarize because: there is less K+ leaving the cell to even out the concentration gradient, because there's a lot of K+ outside already. This means the inside becomes more positive because it retains the K+ instead of leaving through K+ leak channels. 

## Clinical Presentation
cramping


## Other Names:
