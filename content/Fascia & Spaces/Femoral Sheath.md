## Definition
The femoral sheath is a continuation of the transversalis fascia and the iliac fascia. It envelops the femoral artery, femoral vein, and the femoral canal but **does not** enclose the femoral nerve.

## Contents
The sheath is divided into three compartments:
1. **Lateral compartment:** Contains the [[Femoral Artery]]
2. **Intermediate compartment:** Contains the [[Femoral Vein]].
3. **Medial compartment (femoral canal):** Contains lymphatic vessels and nodes, and is a potential space that allows for expansion of the femoral vein.
