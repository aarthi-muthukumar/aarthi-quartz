## Definition
- The adductor canal is a muscular tunnel in the middle third of the thigh, extending from the apex of the femoral triangle to the adductor hiatus in the adductor magnus muscle.
- **Contents:** The adductor canal contains the [[Femoral Artery]], [[Femoral Vein]], and the [[Saphenous Nerve]] , as well as the nerve to the [[Vastus Medialis]].
- **Function:** The adductor canal provides a passageway for the femoral vessels and saphenous nerve to travel from the femoral triangle to the popliteal fossa behind the knee. At the distal end of the adductor canal, the femoral artery and vein exit through the adductor hiatus and become the popliteal artery and vein.
