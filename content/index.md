# Search Function
Use the search function at the top right to search any structure by name. Once you select a structure, all related structures will be shown in graphical 
view. If you are on a desktop, you can also look up structures in the sidebar, as they are in alphabetical order. 

# Updates:
Currently working on making sub-folders for all structures so that they're easier to access. 

This is a Quartz-hosted site. 
See the [documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) for how to get started.
