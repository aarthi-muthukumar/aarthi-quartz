## Review the anatomy of the anterior and medial thigh compartments (Slides 4, 5).


## Describe the surface anatomy and dermatomes of the gluteal region and posterior thigh (Slides 8, 9).


## Describe the bones of the pelvis and thigh, including ligaments and their function ( Slides 10–13).
- [[Sacrotuberus Ligament]]
- [[Sacrospinous Ligament]]
- They both limit the sagittal rotation of the pelvis and sacrum
- Create the [[Greater Sciatic Foramen]] and and [[Lesser Sciatic Foramen]]

## Describe the fascias of the lower limb and posterior compartment of the thigh, including its contents ( Slides 14, 15).
[[Gluteal Aponeurosis]]

## Describe the muscles of the superficial and deep gluteal region, including proximal and distal attachments, innervation, and actions (Slides 16–27).

Superficial Gluteal Muscles
- [[Gluteus Maximus]]
- [[Gluteal Medius]]
- [[Gluteal Minimus]]
- [[Tensor Fascia Lata]]

Deep Gluteal Muscles
- [[Piriformis]]
- [[Gemellus Superior]]
- [[Gemellus Inferior]]
- [[Quadratus Femoris]]

## Describe the muscles of the posterior thigh, including proximal and distal attachments, innervation, and actions ( Slides 28–32)
- [[Biceps Femoris]]
- [[Semimembranosus]]
- [[Semitendinosus]]

## Describe blood supply to the gluteal region and posterior thigh (Slides 34–36).
- [[Superior Gluteal Artery]]
- [[Inferior Gluteal Artery]]
- [[Cruciate Anastamosis]]
## Describe venous and lymphatic drainage of the lower limb (Slides 37; 38).


## Describe cutaneous and motor innervation of the gluteal region and posterior thigh, including the names of cutaneous nerves, terminal motor branches from the lumbosacral plexus, and cord levels that contribute to each ( Slides 39–52).

Motor Innervation:
- [[Superior Gluteal Nerve]]
- [[Inferior Gluteal Nerve]]
- [[Sciatic Nerve]]

Cutaneous Nerves:
- [[Posterior Femoral Cutaneous Nerve]]
- [[Superior Cluneal Nerve]]
- [[Middle Cluneal Nerve]]
- [[Inferior Cluneal Nerve]]

## Describe some clinical correlations of the gluteal region and posterior thigh (Slides 33; 41–43; 45; 47).
- [[Trendelenburg Gait]]
- [[Piriformis Syndrome]]
- [[Gluteus Maximus Gait/Lurch]]
