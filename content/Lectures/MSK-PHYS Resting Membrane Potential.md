## Identify the general concentration, magnitude, and direction of flow of physiologic Na+, K+, Cl-, and Ca++ ions found in and around neurons and skeletal muscle cells.
Think "Salty Banana": at rest, the neuron has more Na+ ions outside of the cell, than inside, and there is more K+ ions inside the cell. 


## Compare the roles of chemical and electrical gradients in achieving a homeostatic electrical steady state in excitable cells
- **Chemical Gradients:**
    - Chemical gradients are differences in ion concentration across the membrane. They drive ions to move from areas of high concentration to low concentration.
- **Electrical Gradients:**
    - Electrical gradients arise due to differences in charge distribution across the membrane. Positively charged ions move toward areas of negative charge and vice versa.
- **Homeostasis:**
    - The steady state (resting membrane potential) is achieved when the chemical and electrical forces balance each other out. For example, while K+ wants to leave the cell due to its concentration gradient, the inside of the cell is negative, which attracts K+ back inside. This balance results in a stable resting membrane potential, typically around -70 mV for neurons.


## Differentiate between the role of concentration gradients, passive ion diffusion, voltage-gated ion channels, and sodium/potassium pumps in the maintenance of resting membrane potential
- Concentration Gradients
- Passive Ion Diffusion  
	- Leaky K+ Channels leak out potassium because of the concentration gradient
- Voltage gated Ion Channels
- Sodium/Potassium ATP pump

## Identify several common electrolyte imbalances and describe how they affect the resting membrane potential of excitable cells
- [[Hyperkalemia]]
- [[Hypokalemia]]
- [[Hypernatremia]]
- [[Hyponatremia]]
- [[Hypercalcemia]]
- [[Hypocalcemia]]

## Understand the factors used to calculate single ion equilibrium potentials, and resting membrane potentials for an entire cell as well as how to apply them in their respective equations
[[Nernst Equation]]

## Understand the dynamics of membrane permeability and identify how changes in permeability can alter membrane potentials
- If the membrane becomes more permeable to K+, the membrane potential will become more negative (hyperpolarization).
- If it becomes more permeable to Na+, the membrane potential will become more positive (depolarization).
- Altering Cl- permeability generally stabilizes or slightly hyperpolarizes the membrane potential.
