## Describe the dermatomes of the lower limb (Slide 9).
[[Dermatomes]]


## Describe the bones of the pelvis, thigh, and leg (Slides 10–12).
See Bone Lab Radiology Lecture & RVU Anki Deck Lecture Cards


## Discuss how center of mass and gravity are important to standing and locomotion; describe a walking gait sequence (Slides 13–15).
- Center of mass is about 10 cm below the navel, anterior to S2. It is in line with the rotational axis of the hips. It is anterior to the rotational axis at the knee
- Steps of Walking: initial contact, loading response, late mid stance, terminal stance, pre-swing, initial swing, mid swing, terminal swing

## Describe the fascias of the lower limb and compartments of the thigh, including their contents (Slides 21; 22).
- [[Fascia Lata]]: the deep fascia of the lower limb
- [[Crural Fascia]]: deep fascia of the leg

## Discuss the muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh, including proximal and distal attachments and innervation (Slides 23–32).
- [[Quadriceps Femoris]]
	- [[Rectus Femoris]]
	- [[Vastus Intermedius]]
	- [[Vastus Medialis]]
	- [[Vastus Lateralis]]

 > *All the superficial Quadricep Femoris muscles insert on the tibial tuberosity via the [[Patellar Ligament]]*

- [[Sartorius]]
-  [[Iliopsoas]]
	- [[Iliacus]]
	- [[Psoas Major]]
 
## Describe the muscles of the medial compartment of the thigh, including proximal and distal attachments and innervation(Slides 35–41)
- [[Pectineus]]
- [[Adductor Muscles of the Thigh]]
	- [[Adductor Magnus]]
	- [[Adductor Longus]]
	- [[Adductor Brevis]]
- [[Gracilis]]
- [[Obturator Externus]]

## Discuss blood supply to the anterior and medial thigh (Slides 42–45).
- [[Obturator Artery]]
- [[Femoral Artery]]

## Explain superficial and deep venous drainage and lymphatic drainage of the lower limb (Slides 46–50).
- [[Deep Veins of the Lower Limb]]
- [[Superficial Veins of the Lower Limb]]
	- Superficially, lymph follows the [[Great Saphenous Vein]] and [[Small Saphenous Vein]], all the way to the Lumbar Lymphatic Trunks
	- Deeply, lymph follows the popliteal nodes, all the way to the Lumbar Lymphatic Trunks

## Describe cutaneous and motor innervation of the thigh, including the names of cutaneous nerves, terminal motor branches from the lumbosacral plexus, and cord levels that contribute to each (Slides 51–56).
Cutaneous Innervation
- [[Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve]]
- [[Femoral Branch of the Genitofemoral Nerve]]
- [[Anterior Cutaneous Branch of the Femoral Nerve]]
- [[Cutaneous Branch of the Obturator Nerve]]

See Ref: [[Femoral Nerve]], [[Obturator Nerve]]

Motor Innervation
- [[Femoral Nerve]]
- [[Obturator Nerve]]

## Discuss spaces of the anterior and medial thigh (Slides 60–63; 67, 68).
- [[Femoral Triangle]]
- [[Adductor Canal]]
- [[Femoral Sheath]]
### **Relationship Among These Structures:**
- **Femoral Triangle as the Starting Point:** The femoral triangle is the proximal region where the femoral nerve, artery, and vein are first encountered in the thigh. The femoral artery and vein are enclosed by the femoral sheath here.
- **Transition to the Adductor Canal:** As the femoral artery and vein leave the femoral triangle, they enter the adductor canal, which serves as a passageway to carry these vessels further down the thigh.
- **Connection and Continuity:** The femoral sheath protects the vessels within the femoral triangle, while the adductor canal protects them as they travel through the middle part of the thigh. The structures within the femoral sheath continue into the adductor canal, and then the vessels exit the canal to become the popliteal artery and vein in the popliteal fossa behind the knee.

## Describe some clinical correlations of the anterior and medial thigh (Slides 25; 33; 34; 44; 47; 48; 52; 64). 2
- [[Meralgia Parasthetica]]
- [[Psoas Abscess]]
