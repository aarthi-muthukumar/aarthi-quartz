## Identify the cause and result of the absolute and relative refractory periods.
Because K+ channels are slow to close 

## Compare and contrast the process of saltatory conduction vs contiguous conduction.

## Describe the clinical consequences of electrolyte imbalance on neuronal signaling function.

## Compare the functional and electrical roles of graded and action potentials.

## Describe the role of myelination in the speed of neuronal impulse conduction.

## Identify the characteristics of EPSPs and IPSPs, and understand the basics of synaptic integration when a neuron has multiple inputs.

## Compare the effects of presynaptic input from GABA vs glutamate neurons.

## Predict the electrical characteristics of a neuron based on the ion channels it expresses.
